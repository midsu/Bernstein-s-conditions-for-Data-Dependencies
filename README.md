## Project 1: Data Dependency
Distributed computing - Bernstein’s conditions for Data Dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction
In this project you will have to analyze the data dependencies between simple instructions. You will consider only simple arithmetic instructions that involve variables whose names are single letter of the English alphabet, the arithmetic operators (+, -, /, *), open and close parentheses, and the assignment operator =. For example: “a = b + ( c – d / e )”. There will be a space between the variables, the operators and the open and close parentheses. Each simple instruction must have at least three distinct variables. You will design two separate algorithms, describe the algorithms using clear pseudocode and implement your algorithms in C/C++/Java, compile, test it, and submit BOTH the report (as a PDF file) and the programs. We do not care about the efficiency of the algorithms but each run of a program must terminate within 60 minutes if N=3

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Algorithm Calculate
Problem: Given a simple instruction and a block of n instructions (n < 11), identify which instructions in the block can be executed in parallel to the simple instruction.

Example 1

| INPUT |
| -- |
|Instruction:
d = b + ( c – d / e)|
|Block
b = b * c
c = c – a
a = a + b * c|

| OUTPUT |
| -- |
|Then the output should be:
a = a + b * c|

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Algorithm Verify
Problem: You are given a number N < 11 instructions, identify all the pairs of instructions that can be executed in parallel.


Example 1

| INPUT |
| -- |
|Block
b = b * c
d = c – a
a = a + b * c|

| OUTPUT |
| -- |
|The pairs of instructions that can be executed in parallel are:
(b = b * c, d = c - a)|

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 2

| INPUT |
| -- |
|Block
a = a * b * c
c = c – a
a = a + b * c|

| OUTPUT |
| -- |
|The pairs of instructions that can be executed in parallel are:
NONE|

Explanation (not part of the output): None of them can be executed in parallel because:

- Instructions I1 and I2 are flow dependent because variable a is generated by I1 as output and used by I2 as input.
- Instructions I2 and I3 are anti-dependent because variable a is generated by I3 but used by I2 and in sequence I2 comes first.
- I3 is flow dependent on I2 because of variable c.
- Instructions I3 and I1 are output dependent because variable a is generated by both instructions.
